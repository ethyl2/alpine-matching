## Matching Game Made with Alpine.js

Experimenting with [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine).

Deployed site: https://ethyl2.github.io/alpine-matching/

This project's code is based on the first episode of the [laracast](https://laracasts.com/series/alpine-essentials/episodes/1), with additional features of
 - shuffling the cards
 - adding images
 - making the scoring more complex
 - disabling the cards when needed
 - adjusting the grid for mobile displays
 - restarting the game after it finishes
